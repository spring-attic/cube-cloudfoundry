Cube on Cloud Foundry
=====================

Note: this is demoware, cube offers no access controls.  Any user with http access can read and write data.


Getting Started
---------------

Deploy this app to Cloud Foundry as a Node.js application with a MongoDB database bound.  That's it.

The collector and evaluator are colocated.
